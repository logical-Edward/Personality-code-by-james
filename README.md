New users given [collaborator](https://help.github.com/articles/permission-levels-for-a-user-account-repository/)
access: it's quite simple to get started \- you can upload your file(s)  
or create a new one, with the Github text editor. If you need to edit some code after adding it to this  
repository, just find the file, click the edit button and paste a new version into the editor or change it there.

Describing your changes is a good idea that helps people understand what you changed \- the  
version control system managing these edits (used by Github under its Graphical User Interface)  
will store this information - also including who did the edit and when it happened.

You can fork this repository to create a separate version.  
Learn more about Github on their help pages and for detailed information  
about version control, see <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control>.
