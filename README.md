> I am writing an application designed to tell you your personality and the sorts of people that you might like.

## New users introduction *(Github v.c. system)*

New users given [collaborator](https://help.github.com/articles/permission-levels-for-a-user-account-repository/)
access: it's simple to get started \- you can upload your file(s) or create  
a new one, with the Github text editor. If you need to edit some code after adding it to this repository,  
find the file, then click the edit button and paste a new version into the editor or change it there.

Describing your changes is a good idea that helps people understand what you changed \- the  
version control system managing these edits (used by Github under its Graphical User Interface)  
saves this information - also including who did the edit and when it was done.

The first time you create/upload your file(s), they get added to a special copy of the main repository  
(a new [branch](https://help.github.com/articles/about-branches/)) where "new ideas can be safely tested" without changing the original files (master branch).

Also, a pull request is automatically created for you - this is a place to [suggest changes](https://help.github.com/articles/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/) and review them  
with other people. All the things you changed (adding/deleting text) can be seen here, shown with a file  
comparison tool called a diff. This helps the repository owner / collaborators to check your work, discuss  
any problems, add their own edits then merge the changes (adding them to the main "master" branch).

  
You can fork this repository to create another version, on your user account.  
Learn more about Github on their help pages (to understand keywords, the [glossary page](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/) has  
explanations) and detailed information about version control can be found in an [article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control) on Wikipedia.
